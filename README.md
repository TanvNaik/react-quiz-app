##### This web application displays 5 random questions with their options and 	on clicking the submit button it displays our score out of 5 . "Play again" button displays another set of 5 random questions.

-  I have stored my questions in data.js file which exports 5 questions.
- I have also created QuestionBox component to display a question along with its options.
